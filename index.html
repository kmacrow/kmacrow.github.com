        <h3>x86.js</h3>

<p>Welcome to the GitHub page for x86.js. From here you can track design and implementation progress, performance evaluation and more!</p>

<h3>What? ...Why?</h3>

<p>Mainly because it's fun, and it has some potentially interesting applications. Wouldn't migrating VMs back and forth between client browsers and your servers be nifty? How about running a linux desktop in a browser tab? Of course you need full PC emulation to do those things, but you need a solid CPU emulator to build one of those, so here we are.</p>

<h3>Okay... How?</h3>

<p>JavaScript has some handy classes for working with binary data these days, and JavaScript engines are super fast, that's how.</p>

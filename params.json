{"tagline":"An x86 CPU emulator in JavaScript!","name":"x86.js","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"### x86.js\r\nWelcome to the GitHub page for x86.js. From here you can track design and implementation progress, performance evaluation and more!\r\n\r\n### What? ...Why?\r\nMainly because it's fun, and it has some potentially interesting applications. Wouldn't migrating VMs back and forth between client browsers and your servers be nifty? How about running a linux desktop in a browser tab? Of course you need full PC emulation to do those things, but you need a solid CPU emulator to build one of those, so here we are.\r\n\r\n### Okay... How?\r\nJavaScript has some handy classes for working with binary data these days, and JavaScript engines are super fast, that's how.\r\n"}
